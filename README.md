# DesignerStore

Here I have created a full e-commerce mobile platform that circulates and maps products and their provided product attributes onto the platform structures that enable a user to view, shop, place into cart and actually buy the items on the platform. There are also multiple images of a product shown and also variations of the size charts available to the user, chosen by a supplier that has an adjacent application. Varies forms of information flow are displayed in the platform and certain information is provided to the user for convenience of use.
